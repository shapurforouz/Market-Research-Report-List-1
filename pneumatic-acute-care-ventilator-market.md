<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Acute Care Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pneumatic Acute Care Ventilator market encompasses two primary types: non-invasive and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators deliver airflow through masks or nasal interfaces, providing support without intubation, making them suitable for patients with respiratory distress who can still breathe on their own. In contrast, invasive ventilators require intubation, allowing for direct airflow into the lungs, which is critical for patients with severe respiratory failure or those undergoing complex surgeries. Both types are essential for effective respiratory management in acute care settings.</p></p>
