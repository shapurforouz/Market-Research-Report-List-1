<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building Isolation Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Bearings</li><li>Sliding Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Building Isolation Bearing market encompasses two main types: elastomeric bearings and sliding bearings. Elastomeric bearings are made from rubber-like materials, providing flexibility and damping to absorb seismic activity, which helps protect structures from vibrations. Sliding bearings, on the other hand, utilize a smooth surface to allow horizontal movement during seismic events, reducing the transfer of forces to the building. Both types enhance structural stability and safety, making them essential in earthquake-prone regions and for high-rise constructions.</p></p>
